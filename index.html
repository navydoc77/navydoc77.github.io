<td>Eddie grew up in Monterey Park, and at the age of 15 was bitten by a spider!  After being bitten he developed a monster headache and his body began to tingle.  Shortly thereafter he could hear conversations through walls.  He could hear his mom and dad talking while in his room and he would walk into the room and to their amazement he would repeat their conversation!<br><br>
One day, after a sprint, he was fatigued and put his hand against a wall for support.  As he regained his breath and pushed off of the wall, his hand stuck to the wall!  Amazed, he placed his other hand on the wall, then his foot, and he climbed the wall with ease.  Thus began the tale of Eddie!
